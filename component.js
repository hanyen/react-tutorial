//Goal: To check if someone has won, we'll need to have the value of all 9 squares in

//Solution: When you want to aggregate data from multiple children or to have two child 
//components communicate with each other, move the state upwards so that it 
//lives in the parent component. The parent can then pass the state back down 
//to the children via props, so that the child components are always in sync 
//with each other and with the parent.

  // when the square is clicked, it calls the onClick function that was passed 
  //by the parent. The onClick doesn't have any special meaning here, but it's 
  //popular to name handler props starting with on and their implementations with 
  //handle. Try clicking a square â€“ you should get an error because we haven't 
  //defined handleClick yet. Add it to the Board class:
  handleClick(i) {

  //The biggest benefit of immutability in React comes when you build simple pure 
  //components. Since immutable data can more easily determine if changes have been 
  //made it also helps to determine when a component requires being re-rendered.
